Manual testing using Jira and Zephyr Squad

The site I tested: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login

I chose to test the PIM - Add Employee module

I created the test conditions for the module based on the testing techniques learned,
and then I created test cases that I added to the Zephyr Squad tool.

I created a Cycle summary in the Zephyr Squad tool.

I reported the bugs that were identified during the testing process in Jira.

I generated the traceability matrix.
